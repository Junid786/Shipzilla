                <p class="third_right_p">
                    There are many benefits to open car transport. First and foremost, it’s cheaper. More vehicles per shipment means a lower average cost per vehicle. Secondly, open car transport is the car shipping industry’s standard. As a result, more open car carriers are available, transporting along more routes. So this type of transport may get your vehicle shipment scheduled and delivered faster.

                <h2 class="third_right_h">Enclosed Car Shipping</h2>
                <p class="third_right_p">
                    For enclosed auto transport we use hard-sided trailers equipped with a lift gate service, which includes a ramp that will lower all the way flat to the ground. Once flat, vehicles are driven on the ramp, and then raised up into the carrier to prevent scraping while loading and unloading. Enclosed car shipping is the preferred method for classic cars, luxury cars, and vehicles with custom paint jobs.
